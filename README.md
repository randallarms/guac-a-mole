##Summary

Whether you want to make delicious virtual guacamole or you're just hoping to smash avocados silly for points, Guac-A-Mole is your game!

Try to guac as many avocados as you can before the round is up, all while stirring the bowl to boost your score multiplier (and the quality of your guacamole, of course). Adding in chili peppers also makes for a spicy bonus -- but avoid breaking the heat meter or your guac will suffer!

Smashing limones (those are lemons, for we gringos!) rakes in a valuable score boost, but accidentally including disgusting ol' rotten avocados will cost you serious points.

Complete medal challenges each round to earn bonus experience! Reaching certain experience milestones (as indicated in the stats page) will improve your Avocado Trophy, accessible through the Medals screen.

So what are you waiting for?
GET GUAC'IN'!
